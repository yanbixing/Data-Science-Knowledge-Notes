- Gradient vs Derivative
  - Gradient: A vector, whose value on each axis takes the corresponding. 
    $$\nabla f(x) = (\partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f)$$
    - The gradient is perpendicular to the contour line.
    - The direction of the steepest slope or grade.
  - Derivative: A scaler. The change speed of the function along a a specific axis/direction. Also called directional derivative.
    $$\partial_\mu f = \frac{\Delta f}{ \Delta x} = \nabla f \cdot \vec{1}_\mu$$

- ML vs Data Mining:
  - Machine Learning: algorithms that can automatically learn with data, without being explicitly programmed.
  - Data Mining: extract knowledge from unstructured data. Use a lot of techniques including ML.
