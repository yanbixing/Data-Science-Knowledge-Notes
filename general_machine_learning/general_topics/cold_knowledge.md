# Cold knowledge


## Some known knowledge

- AI vs ML:
  - ML: algorithms automatically improved with empirical data, no explicit programming.  
  - AI covers other aspects like neural science,robotics, natural language processing etc.

## English questions

- Classifier definition:
  - input: a vector of discrete or continuous feature values
  - output: a single discrete value, the class.

- Model Selection definition: Select model with best performance on same set of data
- What is Bayesian Networks (BN) ?
  - Bayesian Network is used to represent the graphical model for probability relationship among a set of variables .

- What is bias-variance decomposition of classification error in ensemble method?
  - The expected error of a learning algorithm can be decomposed into bias and variance. A bias term measures how closely the average classifier produced by the learning algorithm matches the target function. The variance term measures how much the learning algorithm’s prediction fluctuates for different training sets.

- What is dimension reduction in Machine Learning?
  - Reducing the number of random variables, including feature selection, feature extraction

- What is batch statistical learning
  - Statistical learning techniques allow learning a function or predictor from a set of observed data that can make predictions about unseen or future data. These techniques provide guarantees on the performance of the learned predictor on the future unseen data based on a statistical assumption on the data generating process.

## ?What fk are those Q talking about？
- Inductive Logic Programming (ILP): A subfield of machine learning which uses logical programming representing background knowledge and examples.
- PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning: a learning framework that has been introduced to analyze learning algorithms and their statistical efficiency.
- What are two techniques of Machine Learning?
  - Genetic Programming: The model is based on the testing and selecting the best choice among a set of results.
  - Inductive Learning: The inductive machine learning involves the process of learning by examples, where a system, from a set of observed instances tries to induce a general rule.
- Perceptron: An algorithm for supervised classification of the input into one of several possible non-binary outputs.
- Sequence learning: Sequence learning is a method of teaching and learning in a logical manner.
  - Different categories you can categorized the sequence learning process?
    - Sequence prediction
    - Sequence generation
    - Sequence recognition
    - Sequential decision
  - Different methods to solve Sequential Supervised Learning problems:
    - Sliding-window methods
    - Recurrent sliding windows
    - Hidden Markov models
    - Maximum entropy Markov models
    - Conditional random fields
    - Graph transformer networks
  - The areas in robotics and information processing where sequential prediction problem arises are:
    - Imitation Learning
    - Structured prediction
    - Model based reinforcement learning
- The different approaches in Machine Learning:
  - Concept Vs Classification Learning
  - Symbolic Vs Statistical Learning
  - Inductive Vs Analytical Learning
- Algorithm-independent machine learning: Machine learning where mathematical foundations is independent of any particular classifier or learning algorithm is referred as algorithm-independent machine learning

- Where Pattern Recognition is used?
  - Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Data Mining, Statistics, Informal Retrieval, Bio-Informatics

- Two methods used for the calibration in Supervised Learning?
  - Platt Calibration
  - Isotonic Regression
  - Which method is frequently used to prevent overfitting?
    - When there is sufficient data ‘Isotonic Regression’ is used to prevent an overfitting issue.
- Difference between heuristic for rule learning and heuristics for decision trees?
  - heuristics for decision trees evaluate the average quality of a number of disjointed sets
  - rule learners only evaluate the quality of the set of instances that is covered with the candidate rule.
- two components of Bayesian logic program?
  - The first component is a logical one ; it consists of a set of Bayesian Clauses, which captures the qualitative structure of the domain. 
  - The second component is a quantitative one, it encodes the quantitative information about the domain.
- Why instance based learning algorithm sometimes referred as Lazy learning algorithm?
  - Instance based learning algorithm is also referred as Lazy learning algorithm as they delay the induction or generalization process until classification is performed.
- What are the two classification methods that SVM ( Support Vector Machine) can handle?
  - Combining binary classifiers
  - Modifying binary to incorporate multi-class learning
- What is an Incremental Learning algorithm in ensemble?
  - Incremental learning method is the ability of an algorithm to learn from new data that may be available after classifier has already been generated from already available dataset.
- What is PCA, KPCA and ICA used for?
  - PCA (Principal Components Analysis), KPCA ( Kernel based Principal Component Analysis) and ICA ( Independent Component Analysis) are important feature extraction techniques used for dimensionality reduction.
- The important components of relational evaluation techniques are
  - Data Acquisition
  - Ground Truth Acquisition
  - Cross Validation Technique
