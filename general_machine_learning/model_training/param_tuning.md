- Hyper param tuning:
  - Grid search:
  - Random search: provide the distribution of param rather than exact point.
  - Bayesian optimization:
    - Sequential model-based optimization
    - Next point is selected based on previous point.
  - Cross Validation: use n-1 folds as training and 1 folds are evaluation iteratively.
