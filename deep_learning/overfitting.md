# Overfitting

- dropout: prevent you from too much focus on particular feature
  - The larger dropout ratio, the less importance/influence of an individual neural, the less variance, the less model complexity.
- Reduce model complexity
- More data / Data augmentation
- Early stopping
- Regularization
- Batch normalization
