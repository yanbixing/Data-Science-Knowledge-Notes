# Result Analysis

## 1. Evaluation metric analysis

### 1.1. Examples

We use from cases from an Udacity course as the example. Link: [Udacity-Ab_test](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud257/lessons/4018018619/concepts/40043987150923) or [Udacity-Ab_test(Youtube)](https://youtu.be/6pGDwrJHitw)

Q: the purple ranges (1) - (6) are different confident interval cases (for $\Delta \mu$), analyze the decision we should take.

<div  align="center"><img src=./result_analysis_asset/confidence_interval_cases.png style = "zoom:15%"></div>

**Explanation**:

1. $ \min(\Delta \mu) > d_{\min} \Rightarrow$ practically significant, 
   - I.e., $p_{EG}>p_{CG}+d_{min}$ must stand.
   - Therefore: the EG version are much better than CG version, should launch the new (EG) version.
2. $\Delta \mu$ may be zero, and $\max(\Delta \mu) < d_{\min}$ 
   - I.e. $p_{EG}=p_{CG}$ may stand, and $p_{EG}<p_{CG}+d_{min}$ must stands
   - Since: $p_{EG}<p_{CG}+d_{min}$ must stand.
   - Therefore: the improvement of EG version must be lower than our expectation (i.e. $d_{\min}$), thus, no need to launch it.
3. $\min(\Delta \mu) >0$, but $\max(\Delta \mu) < d_{\min}$ 
   - I.e. $p_{EG}>p_{CG}$ and $p_{EG}<p_{CG}+d_{min}$ must stand.
   - Since: $p_{EG}<p_{CG}+d_{min}$ must stands
   - Therefore: Although there must be an improvement of EG compared to CG, the improvement of must be lower than our expectation (i.e. $d_{\min}$). Thus, no need to launch it.
4. $\min(\Delta \mu) <-d_{\min}$, and $\max(\Delta \mu) > d_{\min}$ 
   - I.e. Both $p_{EG}<p_{CG} - d_{\min}$ or $p_{EG}>p_{CG}+d_{min}$ may stand.
   - Therefore: the EG may be much worse or may be better than our expectation, we are not sure, so need additional tests.
5. $\min(\Delta \mu) <0$, and $\max(\Delta \mu) > d_{\min}$ 
   - I.e. Both $p_{EG}<p_{CG}$ or $p_{EG}>p_{CG}+d_{min}$ may stand.
   - Therefore: the EG may be slightly worse or may be better than our expectation, we are not sure, so need additional tests.
6. $\min(\Delta \mu) >0$, and $\max(\Delta \mu) > d_{\min}$ 
   - I.e. Both $p_{EG}>p_{CG}$ must stand but $p_{EG}>p_{CG}+d_{min}$ may or may not stand.
   - Therefore: the EG must be better than CG, but we are not sure whether it is better than our expectation, so need additional tests.

## 2. Sanity check

- Invariant metric: 
  - metric that have equal size in the control and experimental group.
    - e.g. We assign same amount of id to the control and experimental group. Then, the visits, cookies, events generated by these ids should be same. Or the id we assign to the control and experimental group may have different property, like activity.
  - metric that will not affect by the variant
    - I.e. The metric should come up with the quantities "before" the variant happens, to make sure those quanties in experimental/control group have exactly same property.
    - variant: the different between the experimental and control group
    - e.g. The whole process have three steps: 
      $\begin{aligned}
       &\mathrm{User_{SeeAds}} (U_0)
       \\
       \xrightarrow{\text{Ads}} & \mathrm{User_{See``Purchase"Button}} (U_1)
       \\
       \xrightarrow{\text{\color{red}``Purchase"Button}} & \mathrm{User_{See``Confirm"Button}} (U_2)
       \\
       \xrightarrow{\text{``Confirm"Button}} & \mathrm{User_{BuyProduct}} (U_3)
      \end{aligned}$
      The variant is the color of "purchase" button, the evaluation metric is the "purchase"button-click-through-rate $\frac{U_2}{U_1}$.
      - We can use ads-click-through-rate $\frac{U_1}{U_0}$ as invariant metric, because $U_1$ and $U_0$ will be affect (selected) by our change on "Purchase" Button.
      - But we canNOT use "confirm"button-click-through-rate as invariant metrics, because the $U_2$ for experimental/control group may have different property (like color preference) affected/selected by the purchase button .



## Deep dive: practically and statistically significant

### Meaning of "significant"

"Practically" or "statistically significant" is in terms of the statement "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$"

"**Statistically significant**" means "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" is statistically/mathematically correct. 

However, if $p_{EG}$ just slightly larger than $p_{CG}$, then, even "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" is mathematically correct, there is not too much difference between the experimental version and control version. Then,the experimental version is not worthy to launch. I.e the conclusion "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" have no practical use.

Then, how to determine if the conclusion "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" have practical use?

Remember that, we set a $d_{\min}$ value. This implies we hope the $p_{EG} \geq p_{CG}+d_{\min}$, then, the experimental version is worthy to launch.

Thus, if we can confirm $p_{EG} \geq p_{CG}+d_{\min}$, then, we will say the conclusion "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" from the ab-testing is **practically significant**. I.e. the conclusion "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" from the ab-testing is of-practically-use/practically-useful.

### Experiment result and "significant"

In our experiment, $\Delta \mu$ is the difference between $p_{EG}$ and $p_{CG}$. I.e. $\Delta \mu = p_{EG} - p_{CG}$

From the above section, we can know:

- If $\Delta \mu>0$ stands, we can claim the result is statistically significant.
- IF $\Delta \mu>d_{min}$ stands, we can claim the result is practically significant.

However, with experiment, we can never get the ground true $\Delta \mu$, $\Delta \mu$ has a probability distribution, mathematically, $\Delta \mu$ could be all value. The only matter is that the probability (density) for different value is different.

Thus, we solve the problem in such way:

<div  align="center"><img src=./result_analysis_asset/statistically_and_practically_significant_1.jpeg style = "zoom:25%"></div>

 By setting the confidence level, we can determine limit the possible value of $\Delta \mu$ to a limit range, i.e. *confidence interval*. And if the minimum possible $\Delta \mu$ value, (i.e. $\Delta \mu_{\min}$), is larger than 0 (i.e. $\Delta \mu_{\min} > 0$), it is reasonable to claim $\Delta \mu$ must be larger than 0 ( i.e. $\Delta \mu >0$ stands). Then, we can claim the result is "statistically significant". I.e.:

$$\begin{aligned}
``\Delta\mu_{\min} >0" & = {\text{``the minimum possible } \Delta \mu \text{ value is larger than 0''}} 
\\ &= `` \Delta \mu \text{ must be larger than 0 "  } 
\\ &= `` p_{EG} \text{ must be larger than }p_{CG}" \rightarrow {``H_0 \text{ is incorrect"}}
\\ &\underset{ \text{i.e.} }{\rightarrow} \text{the result is statistically significant}
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, when $\Delta \mu > d_{\min}$, we can claim $p_{EG} > p_{CG} + d_{\min}"$ must be correct, then we can claim the result is practically significant.

$$\begin{aligned}
``\Delta\mu_{\min} >d_{\min}" & = {\text{``the minimum possible } \Delta \mu \text{ value is larger than } d_{\min}"} 
\\ &= `` \Delta \mu \text{ must be larger than } d_{\min}"
\\ &= `` p_{EG} \text{ must be larger than }p_{CG} + d_{\min}" \rightarrow {``H_0 \text{ is incorrect"}}
\\&\underset{ \text{i.e.} }{\rightarrow} \text{the result is practically significant}
\end{aligned}$$

Note, the formula of $\Delta \mu_{\min}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \Delta \mu_{\min} &:= \min( \mathrm{CI}_{\Delta \mu} )\\ 
    &= \Delta\mu^{obs} - z\cdot \mathrm{SE} \\
    &= (p^{obs}_{EG} - p^{obs}_{CG}) - z\cdot \frac{s_{\mathrm{pooled}}}{\sqrt{N}} 
\end{aligned}$$
where 
- z is determined by confidence level $\gamma$, i.e. $z = z(\gamma)$.
- Confidence level $\gamma$ is determined by significance level $\alpha$, i.e. $\gamma = 1-\alpha$
  - Ref:  [Wiki-Statistical_significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance), [Wiki-Confidence_level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), [DataScienceCentral-Blog](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/significance-level-vs-confidence-level-vs-confidence-interval), [Blog](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/hypothesis-tests-confidence-intervals-levels/)


Note: The above discussion is from the point of view of "the location of ground true $\Delta \mu$". So, an alternative understanding is from the point of view of "the location of  the observed $\Delta \mu$ (i.e. $\Delta \mu^{obs}$)"
(The two views are equivalent, since $\Delta \mu_{\min} > 0 \Leftrightarrow \Delta\mu^{obs} - z\cdot\mathrm{SE}>0 \Leftrightarrow \Delta\mu^{obs} > z \cdot SE$. )

<!-- 
When $\Delta \mu > 0$, we can infer that  ${``H_0 (p_{EG} = p_{CG} )\text{ is incorrect"}} $ or ${`` p_{EG} \text{ must be larger than }p_{CG}" }$, then we will say the statement "$p_{EG}>p_{CG}$" is statistically significant.



We made decision by the question whether 

$\Delta \mu_{\min}$ is understand as the smallest possible value for $\Delta \mu$, given the experiment, at certain confidence $\mathrm{C}$.  [Note: $z=z(\mathrm{C})$]

$\Delta \mu = p_{EG}-p_{CG}$ -->






<!-- This is because: -->

## Deep Dive: Confidence Interval

Confidence interval( $\mathrm{CI}$ ): the range where the ground true value will fall in with the probability of confidence level.

Confidence level ( $\mathrm{C}$ ): the probability that the ground true value fall in confidence interval.

E.g. $\mathrm{CI}$ for mean value in ab testing (z-test.)

<div  align="center"><img src=https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-87329ae87bcf6e926acfec80f426aa6b.webp style = "zoom:60%"></div>

$$\mathrm{CI := \mu \pm z\cdot \mathrm{SE}} = \mu \pm z \cdot\frac{SD}{\sqrt{N}} $$

where:

- $z$ score: the width of the $\mathrm{CI}$. 
  - A numerical value, the unit is the standard deviation of the distribution. 
  - Determined by confidence level $\mathrm{C}$. E.g. $z(\mathrm{C} = 95\% ) =1.96$
- Note: The distribution here is the distribution of $\Delta \mu$ i.e. $\sim$ population mean. Thus, the standard deviation of the distribution is SE.
