# Statistical test

## T test vs Z test

Both of them are often used to test mean value of a population.
Both of them required the mean value follows normal distribution.

- Z-test: 
  - test is used when sample size is large (n>50)
  - or the variance is known.

- T-test: difference between two population
  - sample size is small (n<50) and population variance is unknown

### Basics

- T-test
  - One sample vs two sample:
    - one sample: test whether the mean of a distribution has a specified value.
    - two sample: test whether the means of two population are equal.
